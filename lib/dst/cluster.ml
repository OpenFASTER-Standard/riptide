   Task 9: [test/test_vsr_replica_recovery.ml]'s own [with_cluster_and_storage] (Task 8), promoted
   to a real, reusable library module. Structurally the same wiring (Network/Sim_transport
   construction, per-replica Fault_injecting_storage-over-Memory_storage, per-replica dispatch
   fiber, [Eio.Switch.run] + [Cluster_test_done] teardown), with the deviations from that
   precedent -- and from this task's own brief, where it predates Task 8's precedent -- documented
   both here (at each site) and in [cluster.mli]'s own top-level doc comment:

   1. Every replica's [view_number] is pinned to 1 so [replicas.(0)] (replica id 1) is always the
      primary -- see the pin site below.
   2. [settle] is exposed to [body] (the brief's own signature only passed [replicas]) -- see
      [cluster.mli].
   3. [Memory_storage], not [File_storage], underlies each [Fault_injecting_storage] -- same
      reasoning [with_cluster_and_storage] already established (Eio_mock.Backend.run has no real
      filesystem capability), restated in [cluster.mli].
   4. No [stop]/[isolate]/[reconnect] -- Task 8's crash/partition simulation, not needed by this
      task's two required tests and out of scope for Tasks 10/11's own later work. *)
